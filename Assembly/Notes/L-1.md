**Q1: What does a computer system consist of?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Hardware and system software that work together to run application programs.

**Q2: What is ASCII?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è A standard that maps characters to integer values using 8-bit representations.

üÖ∞Ô∏è Preprocessing, Compilation, Assembly, Linking.

---

**Q6: What is the job of the preprocessor?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è It handles directives like `#include`, expands macros, and removes comments.

---

**Q7: What file is generated after preprocessing?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è `.i` file (e.g., `hello.i`)

---

**Q8: What tool converts C code to assembly code?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è `cc1` (the compiler)

---

**Q9: What file does the compiler output?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è `.s` file (e.g., `hello.s`)

---

**Q10: What does the assembler do?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Converts assembly code to machine code ‚Üí `.o` file

---

**Q11: What is the linker's role?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Combines object files and libraries to produce the final executable.

---

**Q12: What is the CPU?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è The Central Processing Unit ‚Äî it fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.

---

**Q13: What is the Program Counter (PC)?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è A register that holds the memory address of the next instruction to execute.

---

**Q14: What does the ALU do?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Performs arithmetic and logic operations.

---

**Q15: What are registers?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Fast, small storage units in the CPU used for quick access to data.

---

**Q16: What is the instruction execution cycle?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Fetch ‚Üí Decode ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Repeat

---

**Q17: What happens when we run `./hello`?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è The OS loads it into memory, and the CPU starts executing its instructions.

---

**Q18: What is the purpose of cache memory?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è To store frequently accessed data closer to the CPU for faster access.

---

**Q19: Why do systems use a hierarchy of storage devices?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è To balance speed and cost ‚Äî faster devices are smaller and more expensive.

---

**Q20: Which is faster: cache, RAM, or disk?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Cache > RAM > Disk

---

**Q21: What is the bottleneck in many programs?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Moving data between components (e.g., from disk to RAM or RAM to CPU)

---

**Q22: Why does "copying" slow down performance?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è Because data has to move between different levels of memory hierarchy, which takes time.

---

**Q23: What is the file extension of a C source file?**
üÖ∞Ô∏è .c

## Question and Explanations

### 1. Compilation Process

![alt text](image.png)

### Step 1: **We Write the Source Code**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

* Stored as `hello.c`
* Written in human-readable **C language**
* Stored on disk as a **text file** using **ASCII encoding**

---

### Step 2: **Now Compilation System Starts**

#### **Compilation Phases and Tools**

| Phase         | Tool Used | Output File | Description                                                                |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Preprocessing | `cpp`     | `hello.i`   | Handles `#include`, macros. Produces a new C file with included headers.   |
| Compilation   | `cc1`     | `hello.s`   | Translates `.i` into **assembly language**.                                |
| Assembly      | `as`      | `hello.o`   | Converts assembly into **machine code** in an **object file**              |
| Linking       | `ld`      | `hello`     | Combines `hello.o` and libraries (like `printf.o`) into an executable file |

---

#### Preprocessing (cpp)

* It Expands macros.
* Inserts contents of `#include <stdio.h>`.
* Strips comments.
* It generates a `.i` File.

#### Compilation (cc1)

* Converts expanded C code to **assembly language** and generate a `.s` File.

```asm
main:
    subq $8, %rsp
    movl $.LC0, %edi
    call puts
    movl $0, %eax
    addq $8, %rsp
    ret
```

#### Assembler (as)

* Converts `.s` file to **machine instructions** (binary format).
* Output: `.o` File.

#### Linking (ld)

* Resolves calls like `printf()` from libraries
* Combines everything into one executable: `hello.exe` or `hello`

---

## Loading and Execution

![alt text](image-1.png)

### Step 3: **Loading the Program into Memory**

* OS loads the `hello` executable from disk to **RAM (main memory)**.
* The **Program Counter (PC)** in the CPU is set to the address of the first instruction.

---

### Step 4: **Execution by Processor**

* The CPU reads instructions one by one using PC.
* Instructions are decoded and executed (using **ALU**, **Registers**).
* Example: output is written to display.

---

### Step 5: **Why Caches Matter**

* Data & instructions are often reused.
* **Caches** store frequently accessed values near the CPU.
* Improves speed by reducing trips to slower RAM/disk.
