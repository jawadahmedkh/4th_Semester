## ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Computer Organization (CO)

This part deals with the internal structure and functional units of a computer.

### Topics Covered

1. **Basic Computer Architecture**

   * Von Neumann architecture
   * Fetch-decode-execute cycle
   * Registers and buses

2. **Data Representation**

   * Number systems: binary, octal, hexadecimal
   * Signed and unsigned integers
   * Floating-point representation
   * ASCII and Unicode

3. **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**

   * Adders, subtractors, multipliers
   * Logic gates and circuits
   * Overflow and carry

4. **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**

   * Types of instructions (data movement, arithmetic, control)
   * Instruction formats (R-type, I-type, etc.)
   * Addressing modes (immediate, direct, indirect, indexed)

5. **Control Unit**

   * Hardwired vs. microprogrammed control
   * Control signal generation

6. **Memory Organization**

   * RAM, ROM, cache, virtual memory
   * Memory hierarchy and access times

7. **Input/Output Organization**

   * I/O mapped vs memory-mapped I/O
   * Interrupts and DMA (Direct Memory Access)

8. **Pipelining and Performance**

   * Instruction pipelining
   * Hazards: data, control, structural
   * CPI, MIPS, throughput

## ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Assembly Language Programming (ALP)

This part teaches you how to program at the lowest software level, close to hardware.

### Topics Covered.

1. **Assembly Language Basics**

   * Syntax and structure
   * Labels, directives, comments

2. **Registers and Memory Access**

   * General-purpose registers (e.g., AX, BX in x86)
   * Addressing modes
   * Stack operations (PUSH, POP)

3. **Instruction Types**

   * Data movement: `MOV`, `XCHG`
   * Arithmetic: `ADD`, `SUB`, `INC`, `DEC`
   * Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`
   * Control flow: `JMP`, `CALL`, `RET`, conditional jumps

4. **Procedures and Macros**

   * Subroutines and parameter passing
   * Macro definitions and usage

5. **String Operations and Loops**

   * `LOOP`, `REP` prefixes
   * Working with strings and arrays

6. **Interrupts and System Calls**

   * Software interrupts (`INT 21h` in DOS)
   * BIOS and OS services

7. **Assembler Tools**

   * MASM/TASM/NASM usage
   * Debugging tools (e.g., DEBUG, GDB)
