#### An Example Letter

```text
The Editor,
The Daily DAWN,
Islamabad Pakistan.
                                                        Athmuqam
                                                        Neelum Valley
                                                        23rd of June 2025
Subject:
        Control of Extra Dearness
Sir,
    Now-a-days in my locality (Athmuqam City (Not Mandatory)) a very serious issue has risen. As, from
the established businessman to a small shopkeeper, everybody has created dearness on his end. They do not care about the allocated rate-list by the district management. Infact, they challenge the authority of the managment openly and freely.
    They even do not hesitate to manipulate the price tags. They put the prices according to their choice. Some brutal shopkeeper even sell expired things by removing their expiry.

Yours Truly
Jawad Ahmed
