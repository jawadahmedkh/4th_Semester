# **Computer Networks Outline**

## ðŸ”¹ **Module 1: Introduction to Computer Networks**

* What is a computer network?
* Goals and uses of networking
* Types of networks:

  * LAN (Local Area Network)
  * WAN (Wide Area Network)
  * MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  * PAN (Personal Area Network)
* Network topologies (Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, Hybrid)
* Client-server vs. peer-to-peer networks

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Module 2: Network Models**

* OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model (7 Layers)
* TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
* Comparison between OSI and TCP/IP
* Functions of each layer

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Module 3: Physical Layer**

* Types of transmission: analog vs. digital
* Transmission media:

  * Twisted pair
  * Coaxial cable
  * Optical fiber
  * Wireless
* Bandwidth, latency, throughput
